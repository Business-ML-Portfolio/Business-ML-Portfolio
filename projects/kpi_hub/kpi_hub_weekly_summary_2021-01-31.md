# Weekly KPI Summary (2021-01-25 → 2021-01-31)

Weekly KPI Summary: January 25-31, 2021

* **Revenue and order volume significantly decreased week-over-week (WoW):** Revenue dropped 79.1% to $5,546, and orders fell 70.1% to 110. This indicates a substantial issue requiring immediate attention.

* **Average order value (AOV) also declined WoW:** AOV decreased by 30.2% to $50.42, suggesting a shift in customer purchasing behavior or product mix.  Investigate if this is related to lower-priced items selling better.

* **The United States remains the top revenue-generating country:**  However, its contribution ($2318) is far below previous week’s overall revenue. Analyze US market performance for potential explanations.

* **Google Knit Blanket is the top-performing product:** This suggests potential opportunities to leverage successful product lines and promote similar items.  Investigate marketing campaigns and customer reviews for this item.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Conduct an urgent investigation into the sharp decline in orders and revenue, focusing on potential external factors (e.g., marketing campaign performance, seasonality) and internal factors (e.g., website issues, inventory problems).

2. Analyze customer segmentation and purchasing behavior to understand the AOV decrease and identify potential strategies for increasing average order value.

3.  Assess the marketing effectiveness across all countries, particularly in the US, identifying any shortcomings that need immediate correction.
